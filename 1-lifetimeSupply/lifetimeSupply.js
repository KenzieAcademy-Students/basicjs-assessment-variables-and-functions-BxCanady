// Exercise One - Computing a lifetime supply of your favorite snack!
//
// You just won a lifetime supply of your favorite snack.
//
// You are going to write a piece of code which will determine how much you
// will actually need to last the rest of your life.
//
// Step one:
//    Prompt the user for three things.
//    * The name of their favorite snack
//    * The number of items of that snack they would eat in a day
//    * Their current age.
//
//    Store each of these things in descriptively named variables.
//
// Step Two:
//    Calculate how many they would need to last them until they are 100!
//
//    Hint: There are 365 days in a year.  Multiply that by the number of years until they are 100 years
//    old (100 minus their current age). That will give you the total number of days.
//    Then multiply that by how many they would eat in a day.
//
//    Store that number in a variable.  That is how many they will eat in their lifetime.
//
// Step Three:
//    Print a sentence to the browser using document.write().
//
//    Your sentence should describe how many of their snack they will eat.  Something like this:
//
//    "Congratulations, you have won a lifetime supply of Snickers!<br>You will receive 2 Snickers 
//    per day, for a grand total of 51100 Snickers."
//
//    Concatenate together strings with your variables to form the message dynamically.
//
//    Then test out your program with different numbers and snack!
