// Exercise Three - Temperature Converter
//
// Build some code which can convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius.
// Based upon the method described here: https://www.mathsisfun.com/temperature-conversion.html
//
// Step One:
//    First, ask the user with prompt() what the temperature is that they are converting.
//    Store their answer in a variable.
//    "What is the temperature in Fahrenheit that you want to convert to Celsius?"
//
// Step Two:
//    Inside the convertFtoC() function convert the temp given from the Fahrenheit to Celsius.
//    The formula to use is: Celsius = (Fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9
//    Finally, return that value as a number.
//
// Step Three:
//    Now print your answer to the browser window using document.write()
//    It should look like:
//    "71.6Â°F converted to Celsius is 22Â°C"
//
// Note that some of your numbers may have many decimal places!
// Like 76.266666666667, that's perfectly fine!  You can leave those as is.
//
// ðŸ‘‡ WRITE YOUR CODE HERE ðŸ‘‡

const convertFtoC = function (temp) {

}
